# Identification in Macroeconomics 
**Student project by Mila Kiseleva**

Identification of causal effects in macroeconomics is challenging: macroeconomic policies and events are characterized by endogenous variation, rare possibilities to organize a natural experiment, complex dynamic structure, role of expectations and by another features. In my project I discuss the main challenges macroeconomists face in identifying the causal effects and approaches they follow to solve these issues. Moreover, I present the baseline results of three recent papers to demonstrate the empirical methods the researchers employ to estimate the causal effects in macroeconomics. 

The results are available in Jupyter notebook: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/milakis/student-project-milakis/master?filepath=student_project_mila.ipynb) [![nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/milakis/student-project-milakis/blob/master/student_project_mila.ipynb) 

The project is based on the four main papers:

2. *Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick and Alan M. Taylor, 2013. "When Credit Bites Back,"* Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Blackwell Publishing, vol. 45(s2), pages 3-28, December;
